To run the entire thing, inside the server folder run
```
npm install
node server.js
```

Inside the root directory run the following to get it going:
```
npm install
webpack-dev-server --inline --hot
```

There's something odd going on with the routing if you refresh instead of use in-app navigation that needs to be addressed. Every tutorial is broken in someway by using old libraries that requires some heavy lifting to switch over.
